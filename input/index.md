# PidPid

## What is PidPid?
PidPid is a collection of spiders (scrapers) which crawl [the following sites](https://doprdele.github.io/pidpid-dashboard/) on a schedule, often more than three times per day. Scraped product information, early links, and images are stored in indexes and accessible via the PidPid web interface.

If you did not receive your credentials after purcashing PidPid, please check your **SPAM** folder and then immediately e-mail or DM us for prompt resolution.

## Abuse and link sharing
Read the full terms of service before purcashing a PidPid subscripton. By purcashing a PidPid subscription, you agree to the terms of service displayed below in addition to the following terms.

While I cannot prevent all users from link sharing, we do monitor logins and log suspicious user activity. If it becomes clear that you are sharing data from PidPid or login credentials to PidPid, your service will be immediately discontinued with no refund offered.

Please do not run page monitors on PidPid. Use the **watch** API instead -- it's far faster, more useful for you, and puts less strain on the PidPid dashboard. Any user who uses page monitors on PidPid, or performs any activity on PidPid which leads to service dedrigation will be asked to cease the disruptive activity in question, otherwise their subscription will be discontinued with no refund offered.
