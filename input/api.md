## API

The first fifteen subscribers will have access to the backend ElasticSearch API in some form for the duration of their subscription. While we do not provide support for the API as we expect most users to access the scraped data through the frontend, you are free to use it. In the future we will offer a more comprehensive and easy to use API for both notifications and searches.
